twitter-alt-gr-w-fix
====================

Small Chrome user script to stop twitter from recognizing AltGr + W (which is 
the only way to make a question mark on some laptop keyboards) as a call to 
open the keyboard shortcuts window.

To install, simply download twitter-alt-gr-w-fix.user.js and drag to Chrome.
